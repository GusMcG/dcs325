Portfolio from Bates College, 2026 Winter Term, DCS325

This is my working portfolio from the course Web Development. Taught by Professor Barry Lawson, the projects shown here span from January 2025 through April 2025.

Feel free to check out any of my branches, including JS, CSS, and HTML. Each branch showcases a different portion of various projects I have worked on, with a corresponding .txt file to outline what I did and why!
